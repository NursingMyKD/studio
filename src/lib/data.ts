    title: 'Cardiovascular System',
    summary: 'In-depth review of the cardiovascular system, common ICU conditions, and nursing interventions, including advanced monitoring and pharmacology.',
    content: 'The cardiovascular system, vital for tissue perfusion, comprises the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart, a four-chambered organ (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle), propels blood through two circuits: pulmonary (to lungs for oxygenation) and systemic (to the rest of the body). Key valves ensure unidirectional flow: tricuspid (RA to RV), pulmonic (RV to pulmonary artery), mitral (LA to LV), and aortic (LV to aorta). The coronary arteries (left main, LAD, circumflex, RCA) supply the myocardium itself.\\nPhysiologically, the cardiac cycle involves diastole (ventricular filling) and systole (ventricular contraction). Electrical impulses originating from the sinoatrial (SA) node (pacemaker, 60-100 bpm) travel through the atrioventricular (AV) node (delay allows atrial contraction, 40-60 bpm intrinsic rate), Bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers (20-40 bpm intrinsic rate), coordinating contraction. An ECG records this activity: P wave (atrial depolarization), QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), and T wave (ventricular repolarization).\\nCommon ICU arrhythmias include: Atrial Fibrillation (AFib - irregular rhythm, absent P waves, fibrillatory waves), often requiring rate control (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) and anticoagulation. Ventricular Tachycardia (VTach - wide QRS, rapid rate), potentially life-threatening, managed by ACLS (pulse vs. pulseless). Ventricular Fibrillation (VFib - chaotic, no discernible waves), requiring immediate defibrillation. Bradycardias (e.g., sinus bradycardia, heart blocks like Mobitz I/II, Third-Degree AV Block) may need atropine or pacing. Supraventricular Tachycardias (SVT - narrow QRS, regular, rapid) can often be treated with vagal maneuvers or adenosine.\\nHemodynamic monitoring is crucial. Arterial lines provide continuous BP (systolic, diastolic, MAP = [SBP + 2*DBP]/3) and arterial blood sampling. Waveform analysis: anacrotic limb (upstroke), peak systolic pressure, dicrotic notch (aortic valve closure), diastolic runoff. Troubleshooting: damping (under-reading SBP, over-reading DBP, flattened waveform - check for air bubbles, clots, kinks) vs. resonance (over-reading SBP, under-reading DBP, "ringing" waveform - check tubing length, stopcocks). Central Venous Pressure (CVP) via central line measures RA pressure (normal 2-8 mmHg), an indicator of RV preload/volume status, but influenced by intrathoracic pressure and ventricular compliance. Pulmonary Artery Catheters (PACs/Swan-Ganz) provide CO/CI, PA pressures (PAS/PAD, MPAP), PAWP/PCWP (indirect LA pressure, normal 6-12 mmHg), SVR (afterload, normal 800-1200 dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵), PVR, and SvO2 (mixed venous oxygen saturation, normal 60-80%).\\nVasopressors/Inotropes: Norepinephrine (Levophed) - alpha1 (vasoconstriction) & beta1 (inotropy/chronotropy) agonist, first-line for septic shock. Phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) - pure alpha1 agonist, increases SVR, can cause reflex bradycardia. Vasopressin - V1 receptor agonist (vasoconstriction), used as adjunct in septic shock. Epinephrine - potent alpha1, beta1, beta2 agonist; used in anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, profound shock. Dobutamine - primarily beta1 agonist (inotropy), some beta2 (vasodilation); for cardiogenic shock, ADHF. Milrinone - PDE3 inhibitor (inotropy & vasodilation); for ADHF. Dopamine - dose-dependent effects (low dose: renal/dopaminergic; moderate: beta1; high: alpha1). Nurses titrate based on MAP, CI, UOP, lactate, mental status, monitoring for arrhythmias, extravasation, tissue ischemia.\\nConditions: Myocardial Infarction (MI) - STEMI (ST elevation) vs. NSTEMI. Diagnosis: ECG (ST changes, T wave inversion, Q waves), cardiac enzymes (troponin). Management: MONA (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitrates, Aspirin), PCI, thrombolytics, beta-blockers, ACE-I. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) - classified by perfusion (warm/cold) & congestion (wet/dry). Management: diuretics, vasodilators (nitroglycerin, nitroprusside), inotropes. Shock (cardiogenic, hypovolemic, septic, neurogenic, anaphylactic) - critical state of hypoperfusion; identify type and treat underlying cause, support circulation. ACLS protocols for cardiac arrest and periarrest states are fundamental.',

    title: 'Respiratory System',
    summary: 'Comprehensive guide to respiratory care, including advanced ventilation, ARDS management, and airway adjuncts.',
    content: 'The respiratory system facilitates gas exchange (oxygen uptake, CO2 elimination). Upper airways (nose, pharynx, larynx) warm, filter, and humidify air. Lower airways (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles) conduct air to alveoli, the primary gas exchange units. The alveolar-capillary membrane is where O2 diffuses into blood and CO2 diffuses out.\\nArterial Blood Gas (ABG) interpretation: 1. pH (7.35-7.45): acidemia/alkalemia. 2. PaCO2 (35-45 mmHg, respiratory component): high in respiratory acidosis, low in respiratory alkalosis. 3. HCO3 (22-26 mEq/L, metabolic component): low in metabolic acidosis, high in metabolic alkalosis. 4. PaO2 (80-100 mmHg): oxygenation status. 5. Base Excess (-2 to +2): overall metabolic status. Assess for compensation: if primary PaCO2 issue, HCO3 changes to compensate (and vice versa). Anion Gap (Na - [Cl + HCO3], normal 8-12 mEq/L) helps differentiate causes of metabolic acidosis.\\nMechanical Ventilation: Modes - Assist-Control (AC-VC or AC-PC): ventilator delivers set volume or pressure for every breath, whether patient-triggered or time-triggered. SIMV: set mandatory breaths, patient can breathe spontaneously between them (often with PS). PSV: patient triggers all breaths, ventilator provides pressure support. Key settings: FiO2 (lowest to maintain SpO2 >90-92%), PEEP (5-20 cmH2O, recruits alveoli, improves oxygenation, prevents atelectrauma), Respiratory Rate (RR, adjusted for PaCO2/pH), Tidal Volume (VT, 4-8 mL/kg Ideal Body Weight for ARDSnet) or Inspiratory Pressure (PIP). Lung protective strategies: Low VT, Pplat <30 cmH2O. Monitoring: Pplat (static pressure during inspiratory hold, reflects alveolar pressure), auto-PEEP (air trapping, assess with expiratory hold), compliance (VT / [Pplat - PEEP]).\\nARDS: acute, diffuse inflammatory lung injury leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight, and loss of aerated tissue. Berlin criteria: timing (within 1 week of insult), chest imaging (bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, collapse, or nodules), origin of edema (respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload), oxygenation (mild: PaO2/FiO2 201-300; moderate: 101-200; severe: ≤100). Management: LPV, prone positioning (for moderate/severe ARDS), conservative fluid management, consider NMBAs for severe ARDS/dyssynchrony.\\nVAP Prevention Bundle: HOB 30-45 degrees, daily sedation interruptions & assessment of readiness to extubate, oral care with chlorhexidine, PUD prophylaxis, DVT prophylaxis. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): obstruction of pulmonary artery; diagnosis via CT angiogram, V/Q scan. Treatment: anticoagulation, thrombolysis for massive PE, embolectomy.\\nNon-Invasive Ventilation (NIV): BiPAP (different inspiratory/expiratory pressures) for COPD exacerbation, cardiogenic pulmonary edema. CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) for OSA, cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy: surgical airway; care includes stoma cleaning, inner cannula changes/cleaning, cuff pressure monitoring (20-30 cmH2O), suctioning. Chest Tubes: for pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion. Monitor drainage (amount, color, consistency), assess for air leaks (bubbling in water seal chamber), ensure suction is set correctly if ordered, check for tidaling (fluctuations with respiration in water seal chamber).',

    title: 'Neurological System',
    summary: 'Focus on advanced neurological assessments, ICP/CPP management, stroke, TBI, and seizure care in the ICU.',
    content: 'The neurological system, encompassing brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, governs bodily functions and cognition. Brain structures: Cerebrum (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes), Cerebellum (coordination, balance), Brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla - vital functions). Circle of Willis provides collateral blood flow. CSF, produced in choroid plexus, circulates in ventricles and subarachnoid space, providing cushioning and metabolic support.\\nICP Monitoring: Devices include EVDs (gold standard, allows CSF drainage and ICP monitoring), intraparenchymal monitors. Normal ICP 5-15 mmHg. Increased ICP (>20 mmHg) can lead to herniation. CPP = MAP - ICP; target 60-70 mmHg. Waveforms: P1 (percussion, arterial pulsation), P2 (tidal, reflects brain compliance - rises above P1 with low compliance), P3 (dicrotic, aortic valve closure). Interventions for ↑ICP: HOB 30°, head midline, osmotic therapy (Mannitol - creates osmotic gradient; Hypertonic Saline - pulls fluid from brain), controlled hyperventilation (PaCO2 30-35 mmHg, transient effect via vasoconstriction), sedation/analgesia, NMBAs, temperature control, CSF drainage via EVD, barbiturate coma, decompressive craniectomy.\\nStroke: Ischemic (87%) vs. Hemorrhagic (13%). Rapid assessment: FAST, NIHSS (quantifies deficit, guides treatment). Ischemic: tPA (Alteplase) if LKW <4.5 hrs, no contraindications (e.g., recent bleed/surgery, uncontrolled HTN, anticoagulation). Dose: 0.9mg/kg (max 90mg), 10% bolus, rest over 1hr. BP control post-tPA: <180/105 mmHg. Mechanical Thrombectomy for LVO up to 24 hrs. Hemorrhagic (ICH, SAH): BP control (target SBP <140-160 mmHg), reverse anticoagulation (e.g., Vitamin K, FFP, PCCs like Kcentra), monitor for vasospasm post-SAH (nimodipine, transcranial dopplers), potential EVD/coiling/clipping for aneurysms.\\nTBI: Primary injury (impact) vs. Secondary injury (hypoxia, hypotension, edema, ↑ICP). GCS: Eye (1-4), Verbal (1-5), Motor (1-6). Score ≤8 often indicates coma, may need intubation. Prevent secondary injury: maintain CPP, oxygenation, normothermia, euglycemia. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) involves widespread shearing of axons.\\nSeizures: Focal vs. Generalized. Status Epilepticus: seizure >5 min or recurrent seizures without recovery. Management: Benzodiazepines (Lorazepam, Diazepam, Midazolam) IV, then load with AEDs (Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin, Levetiracetam, Valproic Acid). Continuous EEG monitoring for non-convulsive seizures/status or refractory seizures. Seizure precautions: padded rails, O2/suction available, maintain airway.\\nSpinal Cord Injury: Immobilize, manage spinal shock (transient flaccid paralysis, areflexia) and neurogenic shock (hypotension, bradycardia, poikilothermia due to sympathetic disruption). Monitor for Autonomic Dysreflexia (in T6 injuries or above): noxious stimulus below injury level (e.g., full bladder/bowel) triggers massive sympathetic response (severe HTN, headache, flushing above injury, bradycardia). Treat by removing stimulus, elevating HOB, antihypertensives.\\nPupillary Assessment: Size (mm), equality, reactivity (brisk, sluggish, non-reactive), shape. Anisocoria (unequal pupils) can indicate herniation. Sedation: Propofol, Dexmedetomidine - balance ICP control with ability to perform neuro exams (sedation holidays).',

    title: 'Advanced Hemodynamics',
    summary: 'Deep dive into hemodynamic principles, monitoring techniques, interpretation, and therapeutic interventions in critical care.',
    content: 'Hemodynamics is the study of blood flow and the forces involved. Key parameters: Cardiac Output (CO = HR x SV; normal 4-8 L/min), Cardiac Index (CI = CO / BSA; normal 2.5-4 L/min/m²). Stroke Volume (SV) determinants: Preload (ventricular end-diastolic volume/stretch), Afterload (resistance to ventricular ejection), Contractility (inotropy, intrinsic myocardial pump function).\\nPreload assessment: CVP (RV preload, normal 2-8 mmHg), PAWP (LV preload, normal 6-12 mmHg). Frank-Starling law: increased preload (to a point) increases SV. Factors increasing preload: fluid administration, HF. Factors decreasing preload: diuretics, vasodilation, hypovolemia. Dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness (e.g., SV variation [SVV], pulse pressure variation [PPV] in mechanically ventilated patients with regular rhythm, passive leg raise [PLR]) are more reliable than static pressures for predicting fluid responsiveness.\\nAfterload assessment: Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR = [MAP - CVP] / CO x 80; normal 800-1200 dynes·s/cm⁻⁵) for LV afterload. Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) for RV afterload. Factors increasing afterload: vasopressors, hypertension, aortic stenosis. Factors decreasing afterload: vasodilators, sepsis (distributive shock).\\nContractility: Difficult to measure directly; inferred from CI, SV, ejection fraction. Inotropes (Dobutamine, Milrinone) increase contractility.\\nArterial Line: For continuous BP, MAP calculation, ABGs. Phlebostatic axis: 4th ICS, mid-axillary line (approximates RA level). Waveform: anacrotic limb, systolic peak, dicrotic notch, diastolic runoff. Damping vs. Resonance: perform square wave test (fast flush) - optimal is 1-2 oscillations before return to baseline. Overdamped: few/no oscillations, underestimates SBP, overestimates DBP. Underdamped: >2 oscillations, overestimates SBP, underestimates DBP.\\nPulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC): Measures RA (CVP), RV, PA pressures (systolic, diastolic, mean), PAWP. Can calculate CO (thermodilution), CI, SVR, PVR. Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation (SvO2, drawn from distal PA port, normal 60-80%) reflects global tissue oxygen extraction. Low SvO2: increased O2 demand or decreased O2 delivery (low CO, anemia, hypoxia). High SvO2: decreased O2 extraction (sepsis, shunting, cyanide poisoning) or high O2 delivery.\\nShock States & Hemodynamic Profiles: Hypovolemic: ↓CO/CI, ↓CVP, ↓PAWP, ↑SVR. Cardiogenic: ↓CO/CI, ↑CVP, ↑PAWP, ↑SVR. Septic (Distributive - early/hyperdynamic): ↑/normal CO/CI, ↓/normal CVP, ↓/normal PAWP, ↓↓SVR. Neurogenic (Distributive): ↓CO/CI, ↓CVP, ↓PAWP, ↓SVR, bradycardia. Obstructive (e.g., PE, tamponade): ↓CO/CI, ↑CVP, PAWP varies (equalization of diastolic pressures in tamponade), SVR varies.\\nTherapeutic interventions: Fluid resuscitation guided by dynamic parameters. Vasopressors for hypotension despite fluid resuscitation (target MAP >65 mmHg). Inotropes for cardiogenic shock/low CO. Vasodilators to reduce afterload in HF or hypertensive crisis.',

Key Settings: FiO2 (0.21-1.0): titrate to SpO2 >90-92% (or PaO2 55-80 mmHg). PEEP (cmH2O): prevents alveolar collapse, improves oxygenation, typically 5-10 cmH2O, higher in ARDS. Tidal Volume (VT mL): target 6-8 mL/kg Predicted Body Weight (PBW) for most patients, 4-6 mL/kg PBW for ARDS. Respiratory Rate (RR breaths/min): usually 12-20, adjusted for PaCO2/pH. Inspiratory Time (I-time) / I:E Ratio: typically 1:2 to 1:3; longer E-time for obstructive disease to prevent air trapping.\\nVentilator Modes: Volume Control (VCV / AC-VC): Delivers set VT. Inspiratory pressure varies with lung mechanics. Pressure Control (PCV / AC-PC): Delivers set inspiratory pressure for a set I-time. VT varies. Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV): Patient-triggered, pressure-assisted breaths. Used for weaning. Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV-VC or SIMV-PC): Delivers set mandatory breaths, allows spontaneous breaths (often with PS) in between. Advanced Modes: PRVC (Pressure Regulated Volume Control): Delivers set VT with lowest possible pressure by adjusting flow/pressure breath-by-breath. APRV (Airway Pressure Release Ventilation): High continuous positive airway pressure (Phigh) with brief releases to a lower pressure (Plow) for CO2 clearance; inverse I:E ratio. ASV (Adaptive Support Ventilation): Adjusts settings based on patient lung mechanics and effort to achieve target minute ventilation.\\nMonitoring & Troubleshooting: Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP): dynamic pressure, reflects airway resistance + elastic recoil. Plateau Pressure (Pplat): static pressure during inspiratory pause, reflects alveolar pressure (keep <30 cmH2O). Driving Pressure (Pplat - PEEP): associated with ARDS mortality, keep <15 cmH2O. Auto-PEEP (Intrinsic PEEP): air trapping; measure with expiratory hold. Causes: high RR, short E-time, airway obstruction. Patient-Ventilator Dyssynchrony: Flow Asynchrony (flow starvation/excessive flow). Trigger Asynchrony (missed triggers, double triggering, auto-triggering). Cycle Asynchrony (premature/delayed cycling). Management: adjust settings, sedation, consider mode change.\\nAlarms: High Pressure: Kinked tube, secretions, biting tube, bronchospasm, pneumothorax, ARDS, pulmonary edema. Low Pressure/Volume: Disconnection, cuff leak, circuit leak. Apnea: Insufficient patient effort. Assess patient first, then circuit, then ventilator.\\nARDS Management: Low VT (4-6 mL/kg PBW), Pplat <30 cmH2O, appropriate PEEP (use PEEP/FiO2 tables or titrate to best compliance/oxygenation), permissive hypercapnia (pH >7.20-7.25), prone positioning (12-16 hrs/day for severe ARDS PaO2/FiO2 <150), conservative fluids, consider NMBAs for early severe ARDS.\\nWeaning/Liberation: Daily Spontaneous Awakening Trials (SATs) and Spontaneous Breathing Trials (SBTs).

    content: 'Time is Brain. Rapid identification and intervention are critical. On patient arrival with suspected stroke: Activate stroke alert/team. Perform immediate neuro assessment (NIHSS by certified personnel). Establish Last Known Well (LKW) time. Obtain vital signs, fingerstick glucose. STAT non-contrast Head CT to differentiate ischemic vs. hemorrhagic. Obtain IV access (2 large bore if possible), draw labs (CBC, CMP, PT/INR, aPTT, troponin, type & screen).\\nIschemic Stroke Protocol: Eligibility for IV Thrombolysis (Alteplase/tPA): Diagnosis of ischemic stroke causing measurable deficit. LKW within 4.5 hours (FDA approved up to 3 hrs, AHA/ASA guidelines up to 4.5 hrs for select patients). Age ≥18 years. Strict Exclusion Criteria: Hemorrhage on CT. Active internal bleeding. Clinically significant bleeding (e.g., GI bleed within 3 weeks). Recent intracranial/intraspinal surgery, serious head trauma, or previous stroke within 3 months. Uncontrolled HTN (SBP >185 or DBP >110 mmHg despite treatment). Seizure at stroke onset if postictal deficits. Known AVM, aneurysm, or neoplasm. Current use of anticoagulants with INR >1.7 or elevated aPTT. Therapeutic LMWH in last 24 hrs. Use of direct thrombin inhibitors or direct factor Xa inhibitors with evidence of effect (e.g., elevated aPTT, INR, ECT, TT, or specific factor Xa activity assays). Platelet count <100,000/mm³. Glucose <50 mg/dL. tPA Dosing: 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg). 10% of total dose as IV bolus over 1 minute. Remaining 90% infused IV over 60 minutes. BP Management during/after tPA: If SBP >180-230 or DBP >105-120, consider IV Labetalol or Nicardipine to maintain SBP ≤180 and DBP ≤105 for first 24 hrs. Avoid antiplatelets/anticoagulants for 24 hrs post-tPA. Frequent neuro checks (q15min x2h, q30min x6h, q1h x16h). Monitor for angioedema, bleeding (especially ICH - severe HA, N/V, acute HTN, worsening neuro status - stop tPA, stat CT). Mechanical Thrombectomy: For LVO in anterior circulation. Window up to 6-24 hours from LKW depending on imaging criteria (e.g., DAWN/DEFUSE 3 trials). Requires CTA/MRA to identify LVO. Tenecteplase (TNK) is an alternative thrombolytic in some centers, especially prior to thrombectomy.\\nHemorrhagic Stroke Protocol: Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): Goal is to limit hematoma expansion. BP control: Aggressive reduction to SBP target (e.g., <140-160 mmHg) using IV Labetalol, Nicardipine, Esmolol. Avoid drastic BP drops. Reversal of Anticoagulation: Warfarin - Vitamin K IV, Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC, e.g., Kcentra) or FFP. DOACs - specific reversal agents (Idarucizumab for Dabigatran; Andexanet Alfa for Factor Xa inhibitors like Rivaroxaban, Apixaban) or PCCs. ICP Management: As per general neurocritical care (HOB elevation, osmotic therapy). Neurosurgical consult for potential hematoma evacuation (especially cerebellar hematomas >3cm or supratentorial with mass effect/herniation). Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH): Often due to ruptured aneurysm. Secure aneurysm (coiling or clipping). Prevent/manage vasospasm (Nimodipine PO for 21 days, maintain euvolemia, monitor with TCDs, induced HTN/hypervolemia/hemodilution - "Triple H" therapy, less common now). Manage hydrocephalus (EVD). Seizure prophylaxis controversial, treat if occur.\\nGeneral Supportive Care (All Strokes): Airway/Breathing: Oxygen to maintain SpO2 >94%. Intubate if airway unprotected or respiratory failure. Dysphagia Screen: Before any PO intake. Formal swallow evaluation if screen failed. Nutrition: Early enteral nutrition. Glycemic Control: Target 140-180 mg/dL. Avoid hypoglycemia. Fever: Treat aggressively (acetaminophen, cooling). VTE Prophylaxis: Intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Pharmacologic prophylaxis (LMWH/UFH) once bleed risk stable (e.g., 24-48h post-ischemic stroke if no tPA, later for hemorrhagic). Mobilization: Early PT/OT. Depression screening.',

    title: 'Safe Medication Administration Guidelines',
    summary: 'ICU-specific policies for ensuring accuracy and safety in medication administration, including high-alert drugs and infusion management.',
    content: 'The "10 Rights" of Medication Administration are foundational: 1. Right Patient (2 identifiers, e.g., name & DOB, scan armband). 2. Right Drug (check MAR, original order, drug label; beware of Look-Alike/Sound-Alike [LASA] drugs). 3. Right Dose (verify calculation, appropriate for weight/age/renal/hepatic function; use leading zeros for doses <1, avoid trailing zeros). 4. Right Route (confirm suitability, e.g., IV vs. PO vs. IM). 5. Right Time (administer within specified window, typically 30-60 min before/after scheduled time; consider drug interactions/food). 6. Right Documentation (MAR immediately after admin; include site for injections, patient response for PRNs/titrations). 7. Right Reason/Indication (understand why patient is receiving med). 8. Right Response/Evaluation (monitor for therapeutic effects and adverse reactions). 9. Right to Refuse (educate patient on consequences, document, notify provider). 10. Right Education (inform patient about medication).\\nHigh-Alert Medications in ICU: Require enhanced vigilance. Examples: Insulin (hypo/hyperglycemia), Anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, DOACs - bleeding risk), Narcotics/Opioids (respiratory depression, oversedation), Sedatives (Propofol, Benzodiazepines - respiratory depression, hypotension), Concentrated Electrolytes (Potassium Chloride/Phosphate, Magnesium Sulfate, Hypertonic Saline - arrhythmias, neuro changes if given incorrectly), Vasoactive agents (Norepinephrine, Dopamine, Dobutamine - extravasation, arrhythmias, hemodynamic instability), Neuromuscular Blocking Agents (paralysis, MUST have sedation/analgesia, respiratory support), Chemotherapy. Independent Double-Check: Required for many high-alert meds. Two licensed nurses separately verify drug, dose, route, patient, pump settings. Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA): Scan patient armband and medication barcode to verify rights; use consistently.\\nIV Medication Safety: Compatibility: Check resources (pharmacist, Trissel\'s, Micromedex) before mixing or Y-siting. Labeling: Label all IV lines at patient-end port and source container with drug name, concentration, date/time prepared/hung, initials. Smart Infusion Pumps: Use drug libraries with standardized concentrations and dose limits (soft/hard stops). Always verify pump programming against order. Trace lines from pump to patient before starting infusion. Titratable Infusions: Clearly defined orders with starting dose, titration parameters (e.g., titrate by X amount every Y minutes), goal parameter (e.g., MAP >65, RASS -2), and maximum dose. Document titrations and patient response meticulously. Extravasation: For vesicant/irritant drugs (e.g., vasopressors, chemo, hypertonic solutions), monitor IV site frequently. If extravasation occurs: stop infusion, leave catheter in place (may attempt aspiration), notify provider, administer antidote if available (e.g., Phentolamine for vasopressors), apply cool/warm compresses as indicated, elevate limb, document. Use central lines for continuous vesicant infusions when possible.\\nMedication Reconciliation: Upon admission, transfer, and discharge to prevent discrepancies and errors.\\nReporting Errors/Near Misses: Report promptly via institutional system (non-punitively) to identify system issues and improve safety.

    title: 'Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI) Prevention',
    summary: 'Comprehensive protocols for CVC insertion, maintenance, dressing changes, and hub care to prevent CLABSIs.',
    content: 'CLABSI is a serious, preventable healthcare-associated infection. Strict adherence to evidence-based bundles is critical.\\nInsertion Bundle (Physician/APP responsibility, RN to ensure/document compliance using checklist): 1. Hand Hygiene: Before procedure. 2. Maximal Barrier Precautions: Cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves for inserter and assistants. Patient covered with large sterile drape head-to-toe. 3. Skin Antisepsis: Cleanse skin with >0.5% Chlorhexidine with alcohol (e.g., ChloraPrep™). Allow to air dry completely (approx. 30 sec to 2 min) before puncture. 4. Optimal Site Selection: Subclavian vein preferred for adults to minimize infection risk if CVC is for non-dialysis/non-plasmapheresis use and not contraindicated. Avoid femoral site if possible. 5. Ultrasound Guidance: For internal jugular and femoral vein cannulation to increase success, reduce attempts, and minimize mechanical complications (e.g., arterial puncture, pneumothorax). 6. Daily Review of Line Necessity: Assess need for CVC daily; remove promptly when no longer indicated. Document this assessment.\\nMaintenance Bundle (Nursing responsibility): 1. Hand Hygiene: Before and after any CVC manipulation (palpating site, accessing line, dressing change). 2. "Scrub the Hub": Disinfect needleless connectors/injection ports vigorously for at least 15 seconds with antiseptic (chlorhexidine, 70% alcohol, povidone-iodine) and allow to dry before each access. 3. Dressing Care: Use sterile, transparent, semipermeable dressings (TSM) or chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge/dressing (e.g., Biopatch™) if no contraindication (e.g., allergy, <2 months old). Change TSM dressings q7 days or sooner if soiled, loose, or damp. Change gauze dressings q2 days or sooner if soiled, loose, or damp. Change CHG sponge with each dressing change. During dressing change: perform hand hygiene, wear clean or sterile gloves (per policy), mask. Cleanse site with chlorhexidine and allow to dry. Assess site for signs of infection (redness, pain, swelling, purulence) with each dressing change and document. 4. Tubing & Connector Care: Change administration sets for continuous infusions not more frequently than every 96 hours, but at least every 7 days. Change tubing for blood/blood products within 4 hours of completing transfusion or q24h. Change tubing for lipid emulsions (e.g., propofol, TPN lipids) q12-24h (propofol typically q12h or with each vial change). Change needleless connectors per institutional policy (e.g., q72-96h, with tubing changes, or if debris/blood visible). Ensure lumens are clamped when not in use or when changing caps/tubing. 5. Bathing: Daily bathing with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) for ICU patients >2 months old (unless contraindicated) can reduce CLABSI rates.\\nBlood Sampling from CVC: Minimize draws from CVC to reduce infection risk. If drawing, use strict aseptic technique. Discard an appropriate volume of blood before obtaining sample (e.g., 5-10 mL, or per policy) unless it\'s a blood culture or certain coagulation studies. For blood cultures: if CLABSI suspected, draw paired cultures (one from CVC lumen, one from peripheral venipuncture, ideally simultaneously). Label source clearly.\\nStaff Education & Competency: Regular training on CLABSI prevention. Monitor adherence via audits and provide feedback. Investigate all CLABSIs to identify contributing factors.',
